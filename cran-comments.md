* For the request "Please do not start the description with "This package",
  package name, title or similar.", The package name is "geboes.score" but also
  there is a medical scoring term named the "Geboes score".  The intent of the
  text in the description is to refer to the medical scoring term not the
  package name (and they are intentionally the same).
* Package title and references were revised
